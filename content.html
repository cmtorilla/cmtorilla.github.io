	            <center><h1>A Proposal To Solving The Virus Outbreak: Battle Royale</h1></center>
	         </div>
			  <div id="satiricalessay">
	         <p> Based on the World Health Organization, Coronavirus is an infectious disease that spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. This virus has caused terror and anxiety in society, but this will not stop us from partying all night! Despite this pandemic, let us not forget to have fun and have interactions with people so we will not be unhappy and depressed at home. I believe in the saying I have made, "There is more to life than just being just at home," so do not be scared to go out, explore, and be yourself. Our situation may be worsening in terms of the number of cases, economy, and other aspects, but I know we and the government can improve this one by one. Other than that, the government has tried to implement different protocols such as the Modified and General Community Quarantine yet our situation is barely improving. Hence, I am here to humbly propose to you a proper and modest solution to help our government solve this crisis.
             </p>
	         <p> Before the primary process, the country should be in total lockdown—no flights or other travel platforms going in or out of the country and local towns to avoid virus transmission except for necessary transfer of goods for the country's survivability. Once this is all settled, we need to test the whole population immediately. If the Philippine population as of 2020 is around 109,581,000 based on the Worldometer’s data, 300,000 tests should be conducted on multiple towns per day. Now, to the primary process, we will start by setting the rules. The COVID tests will occur in one whole town just in one day and will happen inside their homes. Before all the tests are conducted, people will be warned about the possible consequences if they test positive for COVID.
             </p>
	         <p> The COVID positives will be transported by test personnel onto a vehicle, and that vehicle will direct them to the "positive area." It is a place where the COVID positives will be residing and is enough to contain at most 10,000 people. They will be interrogated; the non-minors will choose between two choices: being burned to death or having a chance of living.  If they chose to live, a battle royale will happen. They will be grouped into 100 people and will be inhabiting the island to have an "in real life battle royale there," just like in mobile games. A battle royale is usually a match online where the goal is to be the last player or team standing, by eliminating all other opponents, except this one is in real life. This concept is based on my experience in mobile games like Code of Duty Mobile and PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds. There will be groups there per season that will last for around one to two months. The groups will fight and eliminate each other with resources found on the island, the last group standing in that season will be the winner. The winning group will have a second chance of living and have a VIP pass to the cure if they haven't recovered yet and if there is treatment to the virus already during that period. Now, what about the minors or the children? Healthcare workers at the hospital will treat the children until they recover because they are still young and should be given a second chance of living. If their parents tested positive, they would go under the care of Department of Social Welfare and Development for the time being. For those who will test negative, they will receive an identification code as evidence that they tested negative. They may go out and go back to their everyday lives after the whole town is tested. But, they cannot go out of their town area until their whole region is COVID-free. 
	         </p>
	         <p>There are many benefits to this proposal. This proposal ensures that approximately at least less than two years after the process has commenced, the country will be COVID-free. If people are warned about the consequences before they are tested, they will do their best to avoid contact and stay at home as much as possible. This proposal is an excellent solution to the country's unemployment issue, as seen in our massive economy drop of 16.5% in the second quarter of 2020 which brought our country to a technical recession. With fewer people comes more job opportunities, which will decrease poverty in our country. Also, it solves overpopulation as the battle royale proposal cuts it down. Lastly, this will ensure a safer environment for our health workers and frontliners as they have lesser cases to face.
	         </p>
	         <p>    I believe this proposal is more efficient than the laws implemented by the government because it shows faster improvements comparing the two situations' possible results. It also improves the condition of the social issues present in our country. But if these given situations cannot be achieved by the current government’s condition, then I hope they find an alternative solution to this problem soon. For now, the least that we can do is to wear our masks and stay at home until there is a vaccine available. If going out, make sure to follow social distancing and quarantine protocols. Don’t forget to wash your hands and always bring alcohol to sanitize yourselves. Stay safe and don’t die!
